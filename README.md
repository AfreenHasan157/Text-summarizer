# Text-summarizer
There are approx 1,907,223,370 websites are active on the internet and approx 2,722,460 emails are being sent per second. This is an unbelievably huge amount of data. It is impossible for a user to get insights from such huge volumes of data. Furthermore, a large portion of this data is either redundant or doesn't contain much useful information. The most efficient way to get access to the most important parts of the data, without having to sift through redundant and insignificant data, is to summarize the data in a way that it contains non-redundant and useful information only. The data can be in any form such as audio, video, images, and text. Text summarization is a sub domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that deals with extracting summaries from huge chunks of  the  text and  can been proven helpful. Furthermore, even a website can be created.
